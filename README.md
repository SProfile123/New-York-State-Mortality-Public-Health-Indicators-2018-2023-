# 📊 New York State Mortality & Public Health Indicators (2018–2023)

This repository presents an applied **public health data analytics project** focused on **mortality trends in New York State (2018–2023)**.  
It demonstrates advanced skills in **SAS, Python, Tableau, and epidemiological analysis**, directly aligned with responsibilities of the **Public Health Information Group (PHIG)** to support the **New York State Health Assessment 2024** and the **Prevention Agenda 2025–2030**.

## 🔍 Project Objectives
- Analyze **crude mortality rates** and **annual death counts** across 2018–2023.  
- Explore **underlying causes of death** and demographic disparities.  
- Develop **Tableau dashboards** and **Python notebooks** for interactive and reproducible analysis.  
- Generate **policy-ready summaries and visualizations** for statewide health reporting.

## ⚙️ Methodology

**Step 1: Data Collection**  
- Imported mortality datasets (CSV, SAS).  
- Compiled annual death counts and causes of death.  

**Step 2: Data Cleaning**  
- Standardized year and demographic fields.  
- Removed missing values and validated population denominators.  

**Step 3: Statistical Analysis**  
- Calculated **crude mortality rate**:  
  \[
  \text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Deaths}}{\text{Population}} \times 100,000
  \]  
- Conducted stratified analysis by cause of death and race.  

**Step 4: Visualization**  
- Built **Tableau dashboards** for interactive exploration.  
- Used **Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)** for reproducible plots.  
- Exported high-quality figures for reporting.

## ⚒️ Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- **SAS** → Data cleaning, descriptive statistics, mortality analysis.  
- **Python** → Jupyter Notebook (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for exploratory data analysis.  
- **Tableau** → Interactive dashboards with parameters, filters, and calculated fields.  
- **Epidemiology & Public Health** → Crude rates, cause-specific mortality, population health monitoring.  
- **Reporting & Communication** → Ready-to-use outputs for policy briefs and presentations.
